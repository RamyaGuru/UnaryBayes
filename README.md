# UnaryBayes
A Bayesian framework for the selection, calibration and uncertainty quantification of thermodynamic property models

This will be the repository for the codes associated with a forthcoming paper titled, "Bayesian strategies for uncertainty quantification of the thermodynamic properties of materials." The relevant data files will be hosted in a different repository. These repositories will be populated with the publication of the paper.
